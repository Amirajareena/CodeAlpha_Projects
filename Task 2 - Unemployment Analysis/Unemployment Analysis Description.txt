📊 Unemployment Analysis using Python
This project is part of my Data Science internship at CodeAlpha, where I performed an in-depth analysis of unemployment trends in India using Python. The aim is to understand the unemployment rate patterns over time, identify the impact of events like COVID-19, and visualize insights through data analysis.

🔍 Project Objectives
Load and explore the unemployment dataset

Handle missing values and clean the data

Visualize unemployment trends over time

Identify patterns based on year and month

Understand the effect of the COVID-19 period on unemployment

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
Python

Pandas – for data manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn – for visualization

Jupyter Notebook/VS Code – for development

📁 Features
Line plots of unemployment over time

Monthly and yearly average unemployment comparison

Filtered views for specific years (e.g., COVID-19 period)

Cleaned and preprocessed dataset for better insights

📈 Sample Visualizations
📅 Time Series Plot of Unemployment Rate

📊 Monthly Average Unemployment Rate Bar Chart

🧮 Summary statistics for pandemic-era unemployment

🚀 Getting Started
Clone the repository

Place the dataset (.csv file) in the project folder

Run the Python script or Jupyter Notebook

Explore and visualize unemployment insights

✅ Outcome
This project helped me understand real-world data processing, visualization techniques, and how to extract insights from public datasets. It's a step forward in building a strong foundation in data analytics and storytelling through data.
