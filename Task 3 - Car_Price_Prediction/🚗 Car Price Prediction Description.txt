🚗 Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning
This project was developed as part of my Data Science internship at CodeAlpha. The goal was to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict the selling price of used cars based on various features such as year, present price, kilometers driven, fuel type, transmission, and more.

🔍 Project Overview
In this project, I applied Linear Regression to analyze and predict car prices using a dataset of used cars. The focus was on understanding the relationship between car features and their market value, followed by training and evaluating a regression model for prediction.

📌 Key Steps
📂 Loaded and explored the car dataset

🧹 Performed data cleaning and preprocessing

🔄 Encoded categorical features using one-hot encoding

➗ Split the data into training and testing sets

📈 Trained a Linear Regression model

📊 Evaluated model performance using R² Score and Mean Squared Error

🖼️ Visualized actual vs predicted car prices

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
Python

Pandas – data manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn – data visualization

Scikit-learn – machine learning and model evaluation

📈 Outcome
The model provides decent prediction accuracy and offers insights into how different features influence car pricing. This hands-on experience improved my skills in regression modeling, feature engineering, and evaluation of real-world data.
