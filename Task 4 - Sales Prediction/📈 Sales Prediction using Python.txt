📈 Sales Prediction using Python
This project was completed as part of my Data Science Internship at CodeAlpha. The goal was to predict future sales based on features such as advertising spend, target segment, and platform using a Linear Regression model. The project focuses on transforming raw business data into actionable insights that can assist in marketing strategy and planning.

🔍 Project Objectives

Convert categorical data to numerical using one-hot encoding

Train a regression model to forecast sales

Evaluate model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error and R² Score

Visualize the difference between actual and predicted sales

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
Python

Pandas – data handling

Matplotlib & Seaborn – visualization

Scikit-learn – regression modeling and evaluation

📊 Insights Delivered
How advertising spend and platform affect sales outcomes

Visualization of predicted vs actual sales performance

Business insights to support data-driven marketing decisions
